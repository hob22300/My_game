You enter into the first room, excited to begin exploring these dark dungeons
to find the ancient amulet of Ra. This room is dark, lit only by a soft 
torchlight. You see a vauge outline of a figure hunched in the farthest 
corner of the room. It is about the size of a small child. You decide it best 
to not engage the creature, and tiptoe towards the door. The figure whips it head 
around to look at you. Its eyes are red and skin a sickly pale green. "You shall
never have my precious!!" it screams, and rushes towards you. Quickly, you draw 
your weapon.
