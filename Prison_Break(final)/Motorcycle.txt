You get on the motorcycle. You smile to find the keys in the ignition. You twist
the throtle and the motorcycle reves to life. A rifle cracks, and you are thown
by the impact of the bullet as it hits your kevlar vest. You stay on the 
motorcycle, and go full speed ahead at the chain link fence hoping to burst through. 
However, you dont build enough speed and just kinda bounce off the fence. The
guards have ample time to take you into custody.
