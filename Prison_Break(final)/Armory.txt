You hide from the guard, going into the room on your right, pushing the 
already slightly open large metal door. You put your back to the wall, close
your eyes, and hold your breath. After you hear the guard pass, you open your
eyes and smile -- you are in the Armory. There is a rifle and a full set of riot
gear at your feet. You load the rifle and put on the gear. You run-and-gun your 
way to the front of the prison. There are two escape vechiles, a *motorcycle* 
and a *truck*.
