You have been imprisoned for a year now. But all that is about to change.
The prison book cart comes around. You ask "May I have the Count of Monte Cristo, 
please?" The librarian nods, and hands you the book. As the librarian wheels the
cart away, you smille. You open the book. As you expected, the pages
have been cut and there is a metal file in their place. Only one decision remains,
will you file the bars on your *window* or *door*?
