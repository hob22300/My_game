You run away from the gaurd. Thankfully for you, he has Stormtrooper aim. 
He chases after you -- yelling. The floodlights come on, and alarms come on. 
Guards flock to the watchtowers at the edges of the yard. You get the the end 
of the yard, bullets wizzing by. You can either try to climb the *fence* or you
can jump into the *sewer* pipes that line the yard.
