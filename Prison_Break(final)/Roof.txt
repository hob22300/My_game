You make a left and climb the 30 flights of stairs. At the top of the stairwell
there is a locked metal door leading to the roof. Fortunetly the hinges are 
rusted. One swift kick breaks the door down. However, you realize that you have 
just made a very loud noise, and that guards are probably on the way. Paniced,
you look around. You see a *parachute*. Or you could try and *climb* down the 
side of the prison.
